            <h1>About me: </h1>
            <p>I was born in Peru, but moved to the United States at the age of 3. I am passionate about machine learning 
                and would love to create systems that develop physical therapy, and also help people with mobility disabilities.
                I love deconstructing problems and seeing where they break, as it challenges me and enhances my problem-solving and
                critical thinking skills. In my free time I love watching basketball, and am a huge Phoenix Suns fan. I also enjoy
                listening to music, and a few of my favorite artists are Amin√© and Tyler, the Creator. Be sure to check out my
